***Hi~ Gorgeous.***

## Background
4th March 2022 was the first day Batman was released in SF. As a previous fan of Twilight(Book), I was also a fan of Robert Pattinson even if the movie was not good at all. After many years, Batman was the second movie I saw starred by Robert Pattinson. Unfortunately, I fell asleep too many times because I think it was boring. 

So I'm wondering what he has been doing all these years, why every movie I saw is bad. This led me to do this project, to check what his career looks like based on people's perspectives.

## Objective
The goal is to portray Robert Pattinson's acting career based on people's perspectives on each of his movies using **Web Scraping, EDA, Sentiment Analysis, and Classification models**.

## Data Source
Use **Selenium** and **BeautifulSoup** to scrape the audience reviews and critics reviews from [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1500155/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) and [Meta Critics](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1877830/criticreviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt) of every movie Robert Pattinson stared in.

As a result, we have 8060 audience reviews and 945 critic review.

## Structure
### Robert's Career Overview
- In total, Robert Pattinson acted in 38 movies from 2004 to 2022. Every year, he would shoot at least 1 movie. On average, he would star in 2 movies per year.
